# MAIS 202 - Application Coding Challenge

Loans are an extremely powerful financial instrument; they have the potential to create opportunities and foster growth. To learn more about loans and what influence them, we have provided you with a csv file called *data.csv* that contains information about loans such as their interest rate, purpose, length, grade, and amount in a comma seperated format as shown below.

## Instructions

Your challenge will be as follows:

1. Make a copy of this repository on your own personal github account (you can fork or download it). 

2. Write a python script which loads the dataset, parses the information, and uses it to calculate the average interest rates for each of the listed purposes. 

3. Plot the results onto a graph.

## Sample Results

The output of your script should be similar to the results shown below.

All your source code should be pushed to the personal repository which you have created in step 1, along any necessary documentation explaining how to run your script. Be sure to understand your full solution process, as we will be asking you to explain your results in the interview.

The url to the repository should be included in your application and made public by January 1st, 2019 in order for it to be evaluated. If you have any questions regarding this challenge, please reach out to us through our Facebook page.
